      Before continuing our discussion of the modified M3 E36 Coupe, we'd like to remind you of our last post on the BMW M3:
        This is what the 2024 BMW M3 CS is doing before it challenges the new C63 S.
           The final episode reveals the Arab GT champion, sponsored by BMW M Power.
              The 2023 M3 is available in a new special edition with distinctive colors.
                The old M3 Coupe, which was manufactured in the mid-1990s, received a distinctive design identity, including a wide exterior bodykit provided by LTO (Live To Offend), designed by Khyzyl Saleem, inspired by the M3 GTR race car.

The old car retains the front bumper with rectangular air intakes, but it gains a pronounced splitter at the front that extends below the bumper almost to the ground. The hood with its air vents contributes to the track car identity, and there are integrated intakes and extended side sills that also document the race car look.

          According to Khyzyl Saleem, this mechanically modified old Bavarian is powered by a 3.2-liter S52 inline-six that produces 444 hp (450 PS) on regular gasoline. Adding E85 brings the output to 592 hp (600 PS). These numbers represent a significant increase over the original E36 M3, which only produced 240 hp (243 PS) in US-spec versionsThis modified old BMW widebody kit is for sale on LTO's official website with prices ranging from $4,950 to $7,450 (SAR 18,562 to SAR 27,937)This modified old BMW M3 Coupe looks like it came straight off the race track.

When calculating, consumption and charging performance are taken into account. The values refer to 29-33Â°C as the starting temperature of the battery and the ambient temperature, and exclude auxiliary auxiliary consumables, such as the operation of seat heating, displays and air conditioning. The individual consumption rate (e.g., depending on driving style, temperature and ambient conditions), as well as the actual charging performance, may vary on an individual basis (depending on the state of charge of the battery and the usage rate of the vehicle's air conditioning). Consumption is calculated based on the best-case scenario according to the Worldwide Harmonized Cycle Standards (WLTP) Charging performance is based on the maximum possible charging performance (depending on the charging type and vehicle)

                    <p class="project-category"><span><b>We didn't think it was possible for BMW to release a more controversial M-car than
       the 2021 BMW G80 M3. That was until we saw the first unveiling of BMW's brand-new 2400kg BMW G90 M5 Sedan.
    This latest plug-in hybrid iteration of the BMW M5 was met with a level of opposition we've never seen for a BMWTo complete the rear end, we fitted MHC's performance-style rear lip spoiler which was a super straightforward install and sharpened up the plain smooth OEM boot lid. This is a great-value modification that works perfectly in combination with the diffuser.This 2-piece carbon fibre rear diffuser is extremely aggressive,
        bulking up the rear end to give the BMW G90 M5 more presence on the road. Notably, this diffuser features a removable section over the rear tow eye - something extremely difficult to manufacture from carbon fibre, but MHC did an unbelievable job
  Like all modern BMWs, the G90 M5's fitment leaves a lot to be desired. A large arch gap paired with tucked-away wheels makes the car look far less aggressive than an M-car should. To rectify this issue, we installed some lowering springs & wheel spacers from Bimecc & AST.
      Bimecc Wheel Spacers
           Bimecc came to the rescue with a set of 15mm wheel spacers all-round. This size setup is definitely on the more aggressive side but we do also offer these spacers in 10mm and 12mm. These spacers are slightly different to the standard BMW G Series spacers as, although the G90 M5 has the same 66.6 centre bore, they have a slightly difference PCD of 5 x 132mm. Benefits of going with Bimecc include the lightweight aluminium construction, black zinc coating to protect against rust, as well as the all-important TUV approval.             
       AST Lowering Springs
        To complete the stance, we dropped the G90 on a set of prototype AST lowering springs. The specifications of the production version aren't finalised but this prototype set dropped the car by 38mm at the front & 28mm at the rear to give you an idea.   
      Not only do these modifications look great, but they also address the handling concerns by lowering the vehicle's centre of gravity to reduce roll in the corners and keep that 2,435 kg curb weight under control. The wider track created by the 15mm wheel spacers may also offer a handling benefit, especially during high-speed cornering.</b></span>

                        The figures for performance, consumption and CO2 emissions refer to vehicles with standard transmission.
                        
                        
                        [1] Performance data of petrol engines apply to vehicles using RON 98 fuel. Fuel consumption data apply to vehicles using reference fuels in accordance with EU Regulation 715/2007. Unleaded RON 91 and higher with a maximum ethanol content of 10% (E10) may also be used. BMW recommends RON 95 fuel. For high-performance automobiles, BMW recommends RON 98 fuel.
                        
                        [2] Official data for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, power consumption and electric range was determined in accordance with the prescribed measuring procedure and corresponds to European Regulation (EC) 715/2007 in the applicable version. For ranges, data determined as per WLTP takes into account any optional equipment (available on the German market in this case). For vehicles that have been newly type approved since 1 January 2021, only the official data according to WLTP exists. In addition, NEDC values are deleted from the certificates of conformity as of 1 January 2023 by EC regulation 2022/195. For more information about NEDC and WLTP measuring procedures visit www.bmw.com/wltp
                        
                        Further information about fuel consumption and official model-specific CO2 emissions of new passenger cars can be found in the "Guideline for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and electric power consumption for new passenger cars", available free of charge at all points of sale, at the Deutsche Automobil Treuhand GmbH (DAT), Hellmuth-Hirth-Str. 1, 73760 Ostfildern-Scharnhausen, Germany, and under https://www.dat.de/co2
                        
                        [3] The charging performance depends on the state of charge, ambient temperature, individual driving profile and use of auxiliary consumers. The ranges shown are based on the WLTP best case. The charging times apply to ambient temperatures of 23 degrees Celsius after a preceding drive and may differ depending on the usage behaviour.
                        
                        [4] The EC unladen weight refers to a vehicle with standard equipment and does not include any optional extras. The unladen weight includes a 90% full tank and a driver weight of 75 kg. Optional equipment may affect the weight of the vehicle, the payload and the top speed if the selected equipment has an impact on the vehicle's aerodynamics.
